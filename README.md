# OAuth Video -> The Repository for the Backend of the OAuth2.0 Project Video

This is the Github Repo for the code built inside of the passport OAuth2.0 youtube video I made..
The video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD17CYA1dck&ab_channel=NathanielWoodbury

This code was deployed to Heroku and is production ready

When deploying this code ensure that you fill out the ENVIORNMENT variables when deploying, so that the application runs.

If you are building this locally, ensure you make a file called .env and fill out the variables such as I have done in the youtube video, and make sure 
you are redirecting to your front-end successfully after authentication.
